## Use contextual and dynamic features on bug close time prediction

In this folder, we provide three notebooks showing experimental results for predictions at 25%, 50%, and 75% of the specified SLA time.

Below are the contextual and dynamic features that we used from paper "Using dynamic and contextual features to predict issue lifetime in github projects":
