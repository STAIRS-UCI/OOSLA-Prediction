## Bug report evolution features

In this folder, we provide nine notebooks showing predicted experimental results at 25%, 50%, and 75% of the specified SLA time. Three of them are shown using only team representation features extracted from the CNN. Three of them show modified evolution functions using bug reports. The other three show experimental results combining all features.


Below is the overview of our proposed feature extraction process and extrated features from bug reports to predict the report close time.
